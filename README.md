# WindAndTrees_Wytham
Sample data from 4 pairs of strain gauges at 1.3m on 4 Birch trees in Wytham hosted here 

This data is in matlab .mat format and contains a datenum column followed by 8 columns of strain data. The code 'strain_process' takes this data through the steps to estimating critical wind speeds, if you run it section by section it should be simple enough - the other codes are dependencies and there is a file of wind data. Choices along the way are explored in the issues.
