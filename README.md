# WindAndTrees_Wytham
Sample data hosted here https://goo.gl/NDKQHY

This data is in matlab .mat format and contains a datenum column followed by 8 columns of strain data collected from 4 pairs of train gauges attached to an Oak tree in Wytham Woods. The code 'strain_process' takes this data through the steps to estimating critical wind speeds - the other codes are dependencies. Choices along the way are explored in the issues.
